"""Check the closed form in row_shading_oracle.py against pvlib, an independent implementation.

WHY THIS EXISTS. row_shading_oracle.py is a few lines of trigonometry we derived ourselves.
That makes it clean-room, which is the point, but it also means an error in the algebra
would go straight into the oracle and the oracle would then "validate" the ray tracer
against our own mistake. So the oracle is itself checked, against pvlib's
`shading.shaded_fraction1d`, which implements Anderson and Jensen (2024) and is maintained
by a different community entirely.

pvlib is BSD-3-Clause. It is used here as a reference implementation, not vendored.

WHAT AGREEMENT HERE DOES AND DOES NOT MEAN. Two implementations of the same geometry
agreeing to machine precision says the algebra is right. It says nothing at all about the
product, because neither of them is the product. The number that matters is in the README:
how far the ray tracer, which models a finite array of thick panels, sits from this
infinite-thin-row idealisation, and whether the difference has the sign and the size the
physics says it should.

Run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python pvlib_crosscheck.py

# along the rows, with the collector at a fixed rotation about it. For rows facing south
# the axis runs east-west, and a right-handed rotation about the east-pointing axis tilts
# the collector up toward the south. Hence axis_azimuth=90 with a POSITIVE rotation. The
# equivalent statement is axis_azimuth=270 with a negative rotation, and this script
# checks both, because picking the convention that happens to agree would be exactly the
