"""Closed-form inter-row shading for an infinite array of tilted collector rows.

This is the ORACLE the EnergyFlowX ray tracer is checked against. It is deliberately
independent of the product: a few lines of trigonometry, derived from the geometry below,
with no shared code and nothing imported from the tool.

THE DERIVATION, in full, so the result can be checked rather than trusted.

Take rows of collectors of slope length L, tilted b from horizontal, all facing the same
way, spaced a horizontal distance p apart (row to row, measured between corresponding
points). Work in the vertical plane perpendicular to the row axis, where the sun's
elevation becomes the PROFILE ANGLE:

    tan(profile) = tan(elevation) / cos(sun azimuth - collector azimuth)

Put the origin at the lower edge of the shading row. Its upper edge is then at
horizontal offset L*cos(b) and height L*sin(b). The shaded row's lower edge is at
horizontal offset p, so a point a distance s up its slope sits at:

    horizontal  p + s*cos(b)
    height        s*sin(b)

Trace a ray from that point back toward the sun. It rises tan(profile) per unit of
horizontal distance travelled, so at the shading row's upper edge it has reached

    s*sin(b) + (p + s*cos(b) - L*cos(b)) * tan(profile)

The point is shaded when that is below the shading row's upper edge, L*sin(b). Solving
for s gives the shaded slope length, and dividing by L the shaded fraction:

    shaded = [ L*sin(b) - (p - L*cos(b)) * tan(profile) ]
             / [ L * (sin(b) + cos(b) * tan(profile)) ]

clamped to [0, 1]. Shading grows from the LOWER edge upward, which is why a row's bottom
cells are the ones a bypass diode takes out first.

ASSUMPTIONS, all of which the ray tracer drops:
  - rows are infinitely long, so there is no end-of-row light spilling in from the side
  - collectors have zero thickness
  - the ground is flat and the rows are parallel and evenly spaced
  - only the immediately preceding row can shade (true for the pitches used in practice)

Verified against pvlib's shaded_fraction1d (BSD-3-Clause) to machine precision by
pvlib_crosscheck.py in this folder. Two independent derivations agreeing to 1e-16 is a
statement about the algebra; the agreement with the ray tracer, reported in the README,
is the statement about the product.

No dependencies beyond the standard library. Run it directly to print the table used in
