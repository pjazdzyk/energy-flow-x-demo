"""
Ladybug Tools reference: direct sun-hours on the comparison test box.

Computes the reference values for the IFC Lens vs Ladybug comparison documented
in ../README.md, using the Ladybug Tools Python library (`ladybug`) for the sun
positions — the same Sunpath / NREL-based engine the Grasshopper "Direct Sun
Hours" component uses. Opaque-box shadowing is a ray / axis-aligned-box
intersection (the Direct Sun Hours method = sun vectors from Sunpath +
geometric occlusion).

REPORTS SAMPLES FIRST, hours second, and that is the whole point of this script's
output shape. Both tools march the same 5-minute grid, so every sun-hour either
can report is a whole number of samples; the hours are a presentation of that
integer. Printing only hours (as this did) means anyone reproducing the reference
has to divide by 1/12 h and round to recover what was actually computed, against a
tolerance of ONE sample — and a two-decimal transcription of a sample count is
already 4% of that budget. ../scene/ladybug-reference.csv records the integers, so
this script must be able to produce them.

Run (after `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
    python ladybug_reference.py
