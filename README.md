EnergyFlowX integrates the following of my HVAC engineering libraries:
- [HVAC | Engine](https://github.com/pjazdzyk/hvac-engine) - The physics of air with water vapor content including thermodynamic processes,
- [UNITILITY - Spring](https://github.com/pjazdzyk/unitility) - The physical quantity and units of measure conversion handling library,
- [Brent Dekker Solver](https://github.com/pjazdzyk/brent-dekker-solver) - The enhanced implementation of a famous Brent-Dekker numerical scheme for solving nested equations.

This service is dedicated to HVAC/MEP, mechanical engineers, and chemical and process engineers providing accurate calculations of air properties with humidity
content (Psychrometrics) and thermodynamic processes within the typical parameters scope for HVAC industry applications.<br>

#### EnergyFlowX is planned to be commercialized in the coming months, once the testing phase with end users is successfully completed.

> This is not "_just another psychrometrics calculator_." <br>
> It is a **comprehensive engineering software ecosystem**, designed to support the development of complex engineering projects like this one. <br>
> This product is the result of **years of development, with over 10,000 hours** of personal time invested. <br>
> The frontend is merely the crowning jewel — the cherry on top. <br>

To readers unfamiliar with fluid mechanics and thermodynamics, the calculation forms may appear deceptively simple. 
But **trust me** — there’s nothing simple here once you look behind the curtain… <br>

Fluid parameters are not assumed as constants (specific heat, or density as an example) as in many other available psychrometrics tools. 
Every temperature-dependent property is calculated based on equations available in standards (e.g., ASHRAE), scientific journals and papers,
or formulas derived by myself. You can review the full list of reference sources at the end of this documentation.

## WEBSITE AND API
Eager to see how the project works and help HVAC engineers? Visit the site below, register to create your own free 
account, and feel free to explore the site! <br>

If you are a developer interested in creating your own application—check the API demo. I can provide you REST API as a service
so you could focus on your application business layer instead of investing ~10 000 of hours for building backbone physics libraries as I did.
API-As-Service is available only in individual pricing mode. Contact me directly for details!

Do not forget to say hello!

**NO AI ZONE**. <br>
All calculations use fine crafted algorithms based on existing scientific formulas and equations, implemented from scratch all by myself.
I love AI, but this is not a right project for using LLMs.

## 2. SYSTEM DESIGN
EnergyFlowX is designed as a small microservice deployed on an external server using docker swarm. Separation of Concerns is applied,
and the following independent services have been developed:

- **user manager service** - responsible for handling all user-related functions such as registration or account management,
- **business logic service** - HVAC process and fluid properties computation and units of measure conversion and all other features,
- **reverse proxy server** - Apache NGINX server instance, serving static frontend assets and acting as reverse proxy.

**Backend** service responsible for business logic was developed in hexagonal architecture. Why hexagonal? For practice and training, 
and because I like it. User manager was designed using classic multi-layer architecture.
Both services are designed as modular with separated API and CORE Maven modules. API module is composed of port interfaces to be implemented
by Rest Controllers in CORE infrastructure.<br>

**Frontend** is developed using the latest version of VUE.JS and Quasar, using JavaScript as a main programming language. Plenty of custom-made
components are designed to create ScientificInput acting as a placeholder for physical quantity value and unit with automatic validation
and value conversion when different unit is selected by user. <br>
Frontend is build to be **super lightweight and fast**. There is no single PNG or JPG image used on page. Only vector graphic is used
in SVG format including the icons. Pages are focused to deliver content, to be user-friendly, and to use the available screen size as much
as possible to fill it with relevant content without unnecessary distraction. After all this project is meant to be used by engineers in their daily routine. <br>

**Google Analytics** is used for basic page usage statistics. Proper **SEO** tags have been defined to ensure search engine positioning.

**Security** has been guaranteed following the best industry practices:

- RBAC (role-based access) provided to allow only a certain group of users to access specific content, leaving some content available for everyone,
- RODO / GDPR best practices are followed, application gathers as little data as possible respecting user privacy,
- HTTPS protocol in full/strict protocol used for all pages,
- state-of-art encryption algorithms are used to protect sensitive data,
- secrets are stored in an external cloud key-vault

their own HVAC software systems. API DEMO version is available for free with limited functionality and heavy rate limiters applied: https://demo.energyflowx.com/.
Demo is provided for testing only. If you would like to have access to unlimited API - contact me for a custom pricing offer.

### 5.1. Versioning
Versioning is not planned for simplicity and to avoid maintaining of multiple apis and versions at the same time. However, if
you need it for any reason, please let me know.

### 5.2. Physical quantities master data

This endpoint provides information about all supported physical quantities and their corresponding units. It allows you to retrieve the full list of supported quantities and units, which can be useful for building dynamic interfaces or validating input data.

| LP | PATH                          | MTHD | PATH VARIABLE                     |
|----|-------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------|

| 2  | `/quantities/{quantity-type}` | GET  | **quantity-type** (path variable) |

Example response for `/quantities/temperature`: [Quantities_masterdata_response](assets/json/quantities_masterdata_response.json) <br>

### 5.3. Physical quantities conversion

This service enables the conversion of any supported physical quantity from its current unit to a specified target unit, provided the target unit belongs to the same type of quantity. You can retrieve the full list of supported physical quantities and their corresponding units from the `/quantities` (master data) REST service.

| LP | PATH                                  | MTHD | QUERY PARAMS / REQUEST BODY                                                           |
|----|---------------------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | `/quantities/convert/{quantity-type}` | GET  | **quantity-type** (path variable)<br/>**value**<br/>**from-unit**<br/>**target-unit** |
| 2  | `/quantities/convert`                 | POST | [request-body-example](assets/json/multiple_quantity_conversion.json)                 |

Example response for multiple conversions: [Conversion_response](assets/json/conversion_response.json) <br>

### 5.4. Physical properties of humid air

Endpoints available for users are listed below. Parameters written in bold font are required, the rest are optional. If not
specified - default values will be assumed: <br>
- pressure: "101325.0Pa"
- relative-humidity: "0.0%"
- humidity ratio: "0.0kg/kg"
- imperial-units: "false"

Physical quantities must be specified as a String type with value and associated quantity unit, for example, "20.5C"
as 20.5 degrees of Celsius. For the list of supported units, see the [Unitility](https://github.com/pjazdzyk/unitility) user guide. <br>
Imperial units determine the unit system used in the response. For the input in query param or request objects, you can use
any unit you want from the supported units pool (both imperial and SI).

### 5.8. Sequential process computation
Sequential processing procedure allows specifying multiple connected processes to simulate real HVAC air handling units
or other devices. User specifies inlet airflow and process definitions (up to 20). Output of each process is taken
as input of another process next in line. Calculations are based on sequential processing engine and flow data connectivity 
model developed in HVAC|Engine library.

### 5.9. Unit Overrides
Unit Overrides allow you to specify in which unit a given quantity type should be provided in the response. 
This feature gives you flexibility to receive data in the units that are most convenient for your application or analysis.

Unit Overrides can be specified in two ways:
1. As part of the request body in JSON requests (in the `unitOverrides` field)
2. As query parameters for GET requests (using the `unit-overrides` parameter)

The `unitOverrides` object is a key-value map where:
- The key is the quantity type (e.g., "pressure", "temperature", "volumetricFlow")
- The value is the unit symbol you want to use (e.g., "kPa", "K", "m3/min")

Example of unit overrides in a request body:
```json
{
  "unitOverrides": {
    "pressure": "kPa",
    "temperature": "K",
    "volumetricFlow": "m3/min"
  }
}
```

Example of unit overrides as query parameters:
```
?unit-overrides=pressure_kPa,temperature_K
```

You can retrieve the full list of supported physical quantities and their corresponding units from the `/quantities` (master data) REST service.

### 5.10. Hydraulic Conduit
The Hydraulic Conduit API allows you to calculate flow parameters for different conduit shapes including circular, rectangular, and elliptical. It provides detailed information about flow characteristics, pressure losses, and conduit properties.

Conduit response example: [Conduit_response_SI](assets/json/conduit_response.json)

### 5.11. Error response
In case of validation errors or domain exceptions response will result in HTTP code of 400 (Bad Request).
[InvalidResponse](assets/json/error_response.json) will
be created and returned to user, with the following structure:
```json
{
   "serviceName": "Energy Flow X",
   "cause": "UnitSystemParseException",
   "message": "Unsupported unit symbol: {xyz}. Target class: TemperatureUnits",
   "timestamp": "2024-02-10T14:39:11.8551038Z"
}
```
Exception stack trace should never be returned to the user. If this happens, please let me know as soon as possible.

### 5.12. Swagger Ui
For easier API testing a SWAGGER UI has been provided, follow this URL: https://demo.energyflowx.com
