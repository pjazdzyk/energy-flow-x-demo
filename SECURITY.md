   (Replace `[at]` with `@` and `[dot]` with `.`)

3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including:

## User Responsibilities and Security Best Practices

While we strive to maintain a secure environment, users of Energy Flow X also bear significant responsibility for their own security. To help protect your account and personal data, please follow these guidelines:

- **Keep your password confidential.** Do not share it with anyone.
- Use **strong, unique passwords** that combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Change your password regularly and avoid reusing passwords from other services.
- Always **log out** of your session when you finish using the application, especially on shared or public devices.
- Do not share your account or credentials with others.
- Be cautious of phishing attempts and suspicious links.
- Keep your browser and operating system updated with the latest security patches.
- Report any suspicious activity or potential account compromises immediately.

**Please note:** Energy Flow X **does not take responsibility for security incidents caused by user errors or negligence.**  
Nonetheless, **all security incidents, regardless of cause, must be reported immediately** to help us maintain overall system security.

Failure to follow these practices may increase your risk of unauthorized access or data loss, for which Energy Flow X cannot be held responsible.
